# 0x04. AirBnB clone - Web framework 

A web Framework is a platform that provides a foundation and sit of tools for building and deploying web applications. These framework offer libraries, templates and best practices to simplify the development process, allowing developer to focus more on writting business logic rather than deploying with low-level details.

# Web Flask

This was a sub-project within AirBnB in which I began working with Flask and Jinja2. In this project, I began integrating the back-end storage engine with the web static HTML/CSS pages written earlier.

To run Flask app, execute the following command from the root directory of this project:

~ $ HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost
HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db python3 -m web_flask.100-hbnb

The app can be accessed at 0.0.0.0:5000/hbnb.
